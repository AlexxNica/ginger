Ginger
======

Ginger is an open source host management plugin to Kimchi, that provides an
intuitive web panel with common tools for configuring and operating Linux
systems.

The current features include:
 + retreive system health (sensors) stats
 + user login account management,
 + network interface configuration,
 + configuration backup,
 + Power (ppc) firmware update,
 + Power policy management.

Kimchi is an HTML5 based management tool for KVM. It is designed to make it as
easy as possible to get started with KVM and create your first guest.

- Note on Ubuntu/Debian:

To run the source code in Ubuntu/Debian an extra package is required:

$ sudo apt-get install python-libuser

- Notes on Power policy management feature:

The power policy management feature uses the 'tuned' service to control the
power policies of the host. Problems have been reported with this package,
depending on the host configuration, such as SELinux denials and trouble
to communicate using DBUS with the 'tuned' service started from systemd.

If you find any problems with the power policy management feature, we
recommend following these steps (all steps requires 'sudo' privileges):

- put SELinux in permissive mode for 'tuned' (required if the version of the
package 'selinux-policy' is < 3.11):

$ semanage permissive -a tuned_t

- disable the 'tuned' service from systemd and restart it by hand:

$ systemctl stop tuned.service
$ tuned -l -P -d

Remember to restart kimchid service after these changes:

$ systemctl restart kimchid.service

If these steps do not solve the problem, try to update all 'tuned' related
packages and the packages'selinux-policy' and 'selinux-policy-targeted'.
